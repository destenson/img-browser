  - Research and implement image similarity algorithms
  - Clustering of similar images
  - UI for browsing similar content
  - Threshold adjustment for similarity matching

- [ ] **AI Defect Detection**
  - Identify common AI generation artifacts
  - Classification of defect types
  - Severity rating system
  - Visualization of detected issues

- [ ] **Enhancement Tools**
  - Basic correction tools for common defects
  - Integration with external enhancement tools
  - Batch processing for corrections
  - Before/after comparison

- [ ] **Prompt Management**
  - Extraction of prompts from metadata (if available)
  - Prompt organization and tagging
  - Prompt effectiveness analysis
  - Prompt library and sharing

## Technical Improvements (Ongoing)

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - Profile application performance
  - Optimize media loading and rendering
  - Implement multi-threaded processing

## UI Improvements (Medium Priority)

- [ ] **Dialog Enhancements**
  - Add recursive folder scanning toggle to the folder open dialog (challenging due to Windows COM interfaces)
  - Implement confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
  - Add progress dialogs for long-running operations

- [ ] **Navigation and Interaction**
  - Implement keyboard navigation for media browsing
  - Add drag-and-drop support for files and folders
  - Create customizable interface themes
  - Implement zooming and panning controls for images

- [ ] **Layout and Organization**
  - Add customizable grid/list views
  - Implement collapsible panels for metadata
  - Create resizable thumbnail sizes
  - Add sorting and grouping options in the UI

## Completed

- [x] Initial project structure setup
- [x] Basic Windows integration exploration
- [x] Proof-of-concept image loading and display
- [x] Project documentation framework

## Notes

- Focus on building a solid foundation before adding advanced features
- Consider using a modular architecture to allow for future extensibility
- Research existing media management solutions for inspiration and best practices
- Prioritize user experience and performance from the beginning
- Consider AI integration points throughout the architecture
