# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development roadmap for the img-browser project, which aims to be a full-featured media categorization and management suite with a focus on AI-generated content.

## Vision

img-browser will evolve beyond a simple image viewer into a comprehensive media management solution that helps users organize, categorize, and improve their media collections. It will provide specialized tools for handling AI-generated content, including similarity detection, defect correction, and intelligent categorization.

## Current Status

The project has moved beyond conceptual phase to implementation of core architecture. Basic Windows integration functionality has been implemented, including window management, image loading, and platform abstraction layer design. A flexible architecture is being established to support future features.
