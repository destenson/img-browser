# AI-Generated Content Management

This document outlines the specialized features and approaches for managing AI-generated content within the img-browser application.

## Overview

AI-generated content presents unique challenges and opportunities for media management. img-browser aims to provide specialized tools for organizing, improving, and working with content created by AI image generation systems like DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, and others.

## Key Challenges of AI-Generated Content

### 1. Volume and Iteration

AI systems can generate large volumes of images quickly, often with slight variations:
- Users may generate dozens or hundreds of variations of a concept
- Iterations may have subtle differences that are hard to track manually
- The sheer volume can make organization difficult

### 2. Quality and Artifacts

AI-generated images often contain specific types of artifacts:
- Distorted anatomy (extra fingers, misshapen limbs)
- Inconsistent text rendering
- Unnatural textures or patterns
- Composition issues at image edges
- Inconsistent lighting or perspective

### 3. Metadata and Provenance

AI-generated images have unique metadata needs:
- Prompt text used to generate the image
- Model/system that created the image
- Generation parameters (seed, CFG scale, steps, etc.)
- Version history and iterations
- Source images for img2img generations

### 4. Organization and Discovery

Finding and grouping related AI-generated content requires specialized approaches:
- Similarity is often conceptual rather than visual
- Related images may be spread across multiple generation sessions
- Prompt text provides important context for organization
- Style consistency may be more important than content

## Planned Features

### Similarity Detection and Grouping

- **Visual Similarity Analysis**: Identify visually similar images regardless of file naming
- **Prompt-Based Grouping**: Cluster images based on prompt text similarity
- **Style Clustering**: Group images with similar artistic styles
- **Concept Mapping**: Organize images based on conceptual relationships
- **Smart Collections**: Automatically organize images based on detected patterns

### Defect Detection and Correction

- **Anatomy Analysis**: Detect common anatomical issues (extra fingers, distorted limbs)
- **Text Recognition**: Identify poorly rendered or inconsistent text
- **Edge Artifact Detection**: Find composition issues at image boundaries
- **Texture Analysis**: Identify unnatural or repetitive patterns
- **Correction Suggestions**: Recommend fixes or external tools for detected issues
- **Batch Processing**: Apply corrections to multiple images with similar issues

### Prompt and Parameter Management

- **Metadata-Based Prompt Extraction**: Extract prompt text from file metadata when available
- **Image-to-Text Prompt Recovery**: Use AI models to reverse-engineer prompts from images
- **Multi-Model Prompt Extraction**: Employ various embedding models to extract different aspects of prompts
- **Prompt Accuracy Evaluation**: Compare extracted prompts with known prompts to improve accuracy
- **Prompt Library**: Organize and reuse successful prompts
- **Parameter Tracking**: Record and analyze generation parameters
- **Effectiveness Analysis**: Evaluate which prompts and parameters produce the best results
- **Version Tracking**: Track iterations and improvements of a concept
- **Prompt Enhancement**: Suggest improvements to prompts based on results

### AI Model and Style Management

- **Model Identification**: Detect which AI system likely generated an image
- **Style Tagging**: Automatically tag images with detected artistic styles
- **Quality Assessment**: Rate technical quality of generations
- **Style Consistency**: Group images with consistent stylistic elements
- **Model Comparison**: Compare results across different AI systems

### Workflow Optimization

- **Generation Session Tracking**: Organize images by generation session
- **Iteration Management**: Track progressive improvements of a concept
- **Favorite/Reject System**: Quickly sort through large batches of generations
- **Export for Further Generation**: Prepare selected images for additional AI processing
- **Integration with Generation Tools**: Streamlined workflow with popular AI image generators
